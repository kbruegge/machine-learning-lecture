This collection of notebooks was started for a lecture on machine learning at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona. 
It has since grown into a large part of the statistical methods lecture (SMD) at the Physics department at TU Dortmund University.
It contains some mathematical derivations and small excersises to play with.

Start with the `smd_ml.ipynb` and work your way through the rest. 

As of now, you need to execute this notebook within the project folder since it imports some plotting functions from the `ml` module.
